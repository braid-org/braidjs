# The Braidjs Monorepo

By versioning our code together, it becomes easier to interoperate.

  - Each top-level folder is a project.  Add yours!
  - Now you can make breaking changes (like a protocol change), without
    actually *breaking* anythingâ€”upgrade all the relevant code, across
    multiple projects, at once!

This is not my code.  This is *our* code.

### Projects

### Faq

Q. Wait... can a single repo support multiple NPM packages?

  - A. Yep!  Just create a `package.json` in your project's root folder, and
    then run `npm publish` from it.
