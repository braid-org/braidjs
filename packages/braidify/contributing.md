# Contributing to Braidify

This is core code, and I'd like it to meet everyone's needs!  I welcome
suggestions and improvements on all aspects, including style, features, API
design, and algorithm design.  I'd like to refine this code into a great
reference library.

I also promise to fix bugs and generally help you get your needs met.  Just
let me know what you want!
