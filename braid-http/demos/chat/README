To run the braidjs chat demo:

    git clone https://github.com/braid-work/braidjs.git
    cd braidjs/demos/chat
    npm install express spdy parse-headers
    node server.js

Then open braidjs/demos/client.html in your browser.  It won't work yet
because it doesn't trust the self-signed certificate.  To get around this,
open https://localhost:3009/ in your browser, and then:

  - In Chrome, type the magic phrase "thisisunsafe" into the page
  - In Firefox, click "advanced" and "accept and continue"
  - In Safari, click through the warnings to "proceed anyway"
